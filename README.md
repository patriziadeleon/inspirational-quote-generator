This is a simple and easy random inspirational quote generator that shows you a random quote every time you click the 'next quote' button with the author's name, which the quote belongs to. I created this using HTML, CSS and Javascript.

Click on the index.html file and once the page loads, you can start pressing on the 'next quote' button to generate a random quote with inspirational words from people who are known or not so known but chooses wise words about life.
